        <h1> Final Project Proposal </h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            For my final project design, I am planning to have <b>4 pages</b>: <u>Home, About, Projects, and Contact.</u>
            <br>
            The <b>"Home"</b> page will include a heading with downloaded font, an introduction to the website, and navigation to the other 3 pages.
            <br>
            The <b>"About"</b> page will include a detailed description about my background, education, and experience. It will also include an image of me, or something else related to my description, and additionally navigation to the other 3 pages.
            <br>
            The <b>"Projects"</b> page will include current and past projects I am working on. It will include clickable images or links to the projects that will show up in a new tab, and navigation to the other pages
            <br>
            Lastly, the <b>"Contacts"</b> page will include a contact form, links to my social media platforms, and navigation to my other pages.
        </p>
            <br>
        <p>
            I plan to use CSS styling to include a unique font that I will download online. I also plan to use CSS to adjust the sizing of all of my font sizes, and the color of certain texts. I will also plan to use CSS to adjust the margins and padding of my site, and making sure all my elements will adjust to the screen size.
            <br>
            I plan to use JavaScript to include a hamburger menu that provides easy access to all 4 pages. I would also like to include a contact form using JavaScript.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Behind the scenes, I will organize my repository by using the file/folder structure provided on our "Final Project" assignment page.
            <br>
            <br>
            My primary source of inspiration for the design aspect of my portfolio is to use pastel or earth-tone colors as my main color palette. I want to use calm, softer, colors to set that tone for me and my portfolio. I would still want to make everything simple and minimalst as to not distract from the other elements I am showing on my website.
